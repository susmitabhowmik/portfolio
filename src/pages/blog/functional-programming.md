For our past two sprints we have focused on functional programming. Here are the things I have learned these past two sprints.

1. Functional programing is declarative, rather than imperative.
1. Functional code tries not to change the scope.
1. Functional programming utilizes pure functions.
1. Functional programming uses function composition.
1. Ramda is a utility library for functional programming.
1. Tail call optimization makes it so the stack can be kept clean (see awesome article : https://hackernoon.com/es6-tail-call-optimization-43f545d2f68b)
1. You can link to commit SHAs in git
1. Good code should read like a book
1. Squashing commits and rebasing interactively is an awesome tool (git rebase -i master)
1. Writing and setting up tests in js using mocha and chai so that I know when things break
1. path.join(__dirname, filename) will concatenate directory and file to path

Things I am working on:
1. Naming things better
1. Asking other devs what they are working on rather than focusing on just the questions I have 
1. Walking through and explaining code to others
